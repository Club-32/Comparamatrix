    <h2>Purist Remarks</h2>
    <p>There is no «unrestored» version easily available. Some footage of the film was reused in a wartime short (<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMQg6kPqDQ">comparison video</a>).</p>
    <p>
      DVDBeaver offers a <a href="http://www.dvdbeaver.com/comparisons/comparisons/s/snowwhite/">comparison of the R1
        and R2 versions of the original DVD release</a>. It also offers a <a
        href="http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews47/snow_white_seven_dwarfs_blu-ray.htm">review of the Diamond
        Blu-ray</a>, which includes screenshots comparing it against the Diamond DVD.
    </p>
    <p>In October 2023, a new 4K UHD edition will be released by the same team that brought us the stellar Cinderella 4K
      restoration. This will likely make it the definitive version.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>The Laserdisc and DVD still need extensive comparison.</p>
    <h3>Interesting things to add</h3>
    <p>Bonus content available elsewhere that might be neat to burn on a disc to further enhance the collection.</p>
