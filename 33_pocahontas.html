            accompanied by a short featurette ported over from laserdisc and centering on comments from the supervising
            animator. Each of the 13 sections delivers a gallery of conceptual art. This is presented as it is on most
            Disney animated films' DVDs, with thumbnails (9 to each uniform page) that can be viewed at a larger size by
            selecting them. The volume of artwork here is particularly impressive The galleries provide as follows:
            Pocahontas (148 stills), John Smith (78 stills), Ratcliffe (81 stills), Powhatan (42 stills), Grandmother
            Willow (35 stills), Meeko (24 stills), Flit (16 stills), Percy (21 stills), Thomas (27 stills), Kocoum (30
            stills), Kekata (18 stills), deleted character Redfeather (17 stills), and Art Design, Layouts &amp;
            Backgrounds (a whopping 250 stills). Altogether, that's just shy of 800 stills, which makes Pocahontas's
            Design section a concept art fan's dream. The artwork provides a mixture of things. There are model sheets,
            photographs of three-dimensional models, rough sketches, fully-colored planning art.</td>
